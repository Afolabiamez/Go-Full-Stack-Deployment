# StartTech Enterprise DevOps Platform

An end-to-end production style DevOps project demonstrating how to deploy, automate, and manage a full-stack application on Amazon Web Services using modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC), containerization, Kubernetes, and CI/CD.

This project was built as a real world simulation of how a Cloud/DevOps Engineer would provision infrastructure, deploy applications, and automate delivery in an enterprise environment.

## Live Application

The application is deployed on Amazon EKS behind an AWS Application Load Balancer.

## Project Architecture

The platform consists of two major components:

```
